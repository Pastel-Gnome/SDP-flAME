001;001;Leocadia;Took you long enough! This would never have happened at the shrine of the god of warm food!
001;002;Dagobert;I feel that you lack piety for the god of quiet places. Lower your voice.
001;003;Leocadia;I will do no such thing! If Indistille wanted me to keep my voice down, he would have tried harder to keep his shrine well lit.
001;004;Dagobert;This is what separates the wheat from the chaff. If you cannot handle this, what use are you to your god?
001;005;Leocadia;I'm going to hunt down the person in charge! They'll hear about this! See if I ever come to this backwater village ever again!
001;006;Catellus;Well, I think your mask looks stupid.
001;007;Dog;Woof!
002;008;Character 2;Well hello there.
002;009;Character 1;Yes yes, hello!
002;010;Character 1;Thank you for being here.
002;011;Character 1;Wow, I'm still talking.
002;012;Character 2;Okay, goodbye now.
003;013;Character 2;Hello again! Fancy seeing you here.
003;014;Character 1;Welcome!
003;015;Character 2;Well, we're kind of just sitting here.
003;016;Character 1;Yep, just sitting here...
003;017;Character 2;Totally sitting...
003;018;Character 2;Welp, I guess you should run along now!
